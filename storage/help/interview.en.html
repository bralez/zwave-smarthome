<h3>Configuration incomplete</h3>
<p>Right after inclusion all functions and capabilities of the new device are determined by sending a lot of requests to this device.  If only one of these request are not answered as expected the configuration is considered as not complete. There are few reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
    <li>The device is too far away from the gateway or has any other wireless problems. Please change the position of the device and repeat the inclusion by hitting “Retry”.</li>
    <li>The device is battery operated and went to deep sleep too fast. Try to wakeup the device (refer to manual for this) or repeat the inclusion by hitting “Retry”.</li>
    <li>The new device is just broken or was not Z-Wave certified. Double check the status of the device with the official Z-Wave Certification database at www.z-wavealliance.org.</li> 
</ol>
<p>Z-Wave professionals may be able to dig into details of the problems by referring to the Z-Wave Experts User Interface at :8083/expert. This interface requires a web browser and will not work with native apps.</p>
